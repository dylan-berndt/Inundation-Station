# Inundation Station

Global flood prediction model based on Google's Flood Hub and several spatio-temporal graph architectures. Uses a graph neural network on upstream basins to prevent information loss due to area-weighted averaging over large upstream basin geometries. 

Operates on ERA5-Land data aggregated over HydroATLAS Level 7 basin geometries, predicting GRDC flow data for North America.

Future work would see aggregation over level 12 geometries for maximum granularity, as well as a global scale dataset.
